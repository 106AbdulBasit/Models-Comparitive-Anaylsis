## Comparison of Pre-trained Keras Models for Transfer Learning

This project aims to compare the performance of different pre-trained Keras models for transfer learning on a given dataset. The goal is to evaluate the models based on various evaluation metrics and determine the best-performing model for the given task.

The project includes the implementation and comparison of the following pre-trained models:
- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- InceptionV3
- Xception

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Keras and TensorFlow libraries
